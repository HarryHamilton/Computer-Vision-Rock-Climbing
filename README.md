Interactive Rock Climbing Game
--------------------------

The purpose behind creating this project was to provide a fun way to warm-up when bouldering. Simply set the points on the wall by editing
the coordinates in the code, and then open the project and start climbing! once all of the coordinates have been hit by the climber, the 
program will display how long it took. It makes for fun competitions against friends and can get everyone quite competitive!

How to use the project
--------------------------
1. Download the project and install CV2 (see: https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)
2. Open Pycharm, or any other IDE
3. Edit the coordinates in the code
4. Run the project and start climbing

Note
--------------------------
It is my intention to further develop the program to allow the user to select the coordinates by using their mousepad.
